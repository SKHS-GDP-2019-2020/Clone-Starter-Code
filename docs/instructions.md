# Instructions

1. Start by making a _fork_ of the **[{{site.data.assignment.starter-code-name}}][starter-code-url]** repository, this gives you a copy of your own to work with.
1. To work with the **{{site.data.assignment.starter-code-name}}** repository, you will need a copy on your computer. Git calls this step _cloning_. Start by finding the green **Clone or Download** button.
1. Click on the **Clone or Download** button and select the **Open in Desktop** option.
   - Since you probably haven't used GitHub Desktop on this computer before you will be taken to the GitHub Desktop download page.
   - Go ahead and download the Windows 64-bit version.
   - After GitHub Desktop downloads double-click on the dowloaded file in the lower left corner of your browser window.
   - Run the installer.
   - GitHub Desktop does not install globally (for all users), this is why you can install it. But this also means that you will have to do this anytime you are using a new computer.
1. GitHub Desktop will launch.
1. Sign in to your GitHub account.
1. Select the folder where you want to clone the **{{site.data.assignment.starter-code-name}}** repository. I recommend putting your GitHub repositories in a folder named GitHub on your desktop (e.g., C:\Users\<your login name>\Desktop\GitHub). 

   The reason it is ok to accept the default is that you are going to be pushing your changes to GitHub regularly. So the risk if losing work on the C: drive is reduced. In exchange you will get better performance from Unity.
1. Clone the repository. The first time you clone with GitHub Desktop on a computer you will need to edit the Git configuration. Otherwise our firewall will trip you up. Using Git Bash enter this command:

   ```git config --global http.sslverify false```
1. Make a branch named **step-1** - having a common naming pattern for our branches will make it easier to talk about where we are in the project.

All that is left is to submit your work. Go to the **Submission** tab and do that.
